For this project, I used React library to create an image gallery app.

I applied some of the best practices of working with React, like using JSX to write markup-like syntax directly in my JS files and managing state in a container component that passes data down to reusable stateless components. Additionally, I got practice working with React-supportive tools like Vite and React Router.

Using the powerful Vite build tool, I set up the initial project.

Then I...

- Used JavaScript and JSX to build out the gallery components in a modular fashion.
- Used React Router to set up routes for three default topic pages and a search page.
- Used the Fetch API or a tool like Axios to fetch data from the Flickr API and used it to display images in my app.
- Added logic to handle the search and various requirements of the project.
- Added to the supplied CSS to personalize the project.
